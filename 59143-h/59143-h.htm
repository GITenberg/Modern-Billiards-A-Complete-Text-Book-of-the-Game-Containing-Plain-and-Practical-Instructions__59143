</div>

<p class='c006'>Apart from its inviting to moderate and wholesome exercise,
billiards, as popularly played, is pre-eminently a mental
pastime. Nearly all its exponents of approved skill, whatever
were the drawbacks of their youth, are intellectually
quick and bright. This is due in some measure to the ready
mathematical requirements of the play as a routine, but in a
much greater degree to its taxing the eye, stimulating the
fancy, and disciplining the mind by imposing watchfulness,
invention, and analysis. Slowness is costly, and hence, as
an early habit, an eager alertness of vision, alacrity of step,
and promptitude of decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding billiards as a spectacle, its physical requisites
to perfection are keen sight, level head and steady hand;
but they are by no means essential to enjoyment of it as a
leisure-hour diversion <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en amateur</span></i>. In this sense, its charm
lies altogether in participation, which is all the more agreeable
and healthful because never needing to be exhausting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caroming methods are still changing. Execution is again
growing less fantastic and more practical. Systemization
is becoming more and more dominant. In consequence,
certain gathering shots, depicting instructive possibilities
rather than downright needs, and diagrammed as still proper
to teach when the earlier edition of this book was issued, have
no place in the present volume.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Play has been made harder in theory, but easier in fact.
Lowering the cushion first and the table next has facilitated
most strokes, and particularly those dependent upon elevating
the cue. Our fathers knew <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piqué</span></i>, but seldom <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">massé</span></i>.
Drawing a ball without hopping it has been made surer.
Cloths were once so much heavier in nap that ironing new
ones again and again, until the iron burned them out, was
the method here, as it is in certain other countries yet.
Although longer than the present ones by several inches, yet
still choice cues of old rarely went beyond eighteen ounces.
For special needs there are cues now whose butts alone are
heavier than an old-fashioned cue in its entirety. The
lighter ashen sticks of the past were meant for a greater
variety of shots than the experts’ carom game of to-day has
use for. Styles of play as a matter of contest are also
different. If the present generation know better how to
count, their elders knew better when not to try and count.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been progress in more directions than one. A
light-weight cue never before handled by its wielder played
the last 1900 points of a memorable contest. Our “Record”
has no other one-night match so impressive for headwork,
handicraft, and hazard. In the same year, and in the same
State, a mile in harness was trotted in 2:19¾, but under
wholly different conditions from those which to-day govern
track, equipment, transportation, and individual effort. As
in the popular eye some Cresceus or Lou Dillon now completely
obscures the bob-tailed, homely little bay mare at
Kalamazoo, so the billiard giants of these times are apt to
overlook that the credit they receive for a marvelous progress
as counters may not be exclusively their own. Some
share in it is possibly due to improvements that first-class
mechanicians have made in billiard implements. Rubber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>vulcanized in layers of different densities in the one strip
have made cushion-angles trustier, cloths are of closer shear
and more uniformly spread, choice cue-leathers are choicer,
cues have grown magical in their mere heft of hilt, and vanished
is the muslin under-cloth that helped the balls to dig
their graves deep into the one of green. Rarely seen, if ever
now, is the serrated cushion, with a face like a saw whose
dulled teeth are set inches apart, and not often is there complaint
that the speed of the bed is greater than that of the
return from the cushion, or else not quite so great.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h2 id='HISTORICAL' class='c005'>HISTORICAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Billiards was practically without beginning. As with
untold other excellences, so with that. Until merit is established,
curiosity as to origin rarely begins. When merit is
acknowledged, it is too late to trace origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us to billiards, Charmion,” is one of Shakespeare’s
many anachronisms. As introduced into “Antony and Cleopatra,”
its significance is simply that the amusement was
growing in favor at the English court in the time of Elizabeth,
Shakespeare, and Mary, Queen of Scots, the last of whom
had brought her table over with her from France.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diligent student may read that Socrates played billiards,
that Anacharsis saw it played during his travels in
Greece, that St. Augustine saw a billiard-table in journeying
to or in Africa, and that Cathire More, an Irish king of the
second century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, bequeathed to his nephew “fifty billiard-balls
of brass, with the pools and cues of the same material.”
But the student must not go so far back as the originals in
his search, lest he discover that all are translators’ errors.
St. Augustine’s vision has proved to be nothing else.</p>

<p class='c007'>Billiards is also of quasi-historical record as having been
invented by Henri de Vigne, a Frenchman, for the amusement
of Louis XI. As runs a story more explicit, though
probably no trustier, De Vigne was only a carpenter, or
cabinet-maker, who, at the order of Louis, fashioned “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>billiard-table with a bed of stone, covered with cloth, and
having a hole in the centre, into which the balls were driven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A more plausible recital is that the game was introduced
to both France and England centuries before, when the
Knights-Templars returned from their first or second crusade
in the Holy Land. But why not have been introduced into
Spain and Italy at the same period? Rome should have been
a likely spot for this game of the monasteries of the East to
reach, and yet Rome’s ample archives seem to have shed no
light upon it, although we find the “Lives of the Roman
Pontiffs” mentioning one Pope who was fond of billiards, it
being the Italian game of a century or so ago. Any game of
Eastern origin should have reached Spain, through the Moors,
centuries before France or England got it via Palestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>History is no happier in taking liberties with our own
country by variously assigning the honor of introducing
billiards here to the Spaniards in Florida under De Soto, to
the English Cavaliers in Virginia, to the Huguenots settling in
South Carolina in 1690, and to the primitive Hollanders of
Manhattan Island. But why not to the earlier Spaniards in
Florida under Ponce de Leon, to the English Cavaliers who
settled one-half of the province of New Jersey, and to the
Huguenots who founded New Rochelle, N. Y., at the same
time that kindred refugees found lodgment in South Carolina?
Other nationalities have both played the game and kept rooms
in once pre-eminently cosmopolitan Holland, but the Dutch
themselves have never-been a billiard-playing people; and
the official proceedings before the schouts, scheppens and
burgomasters of New Amsterdam may safely be challenged
to show any allusion whatever to billiards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remote literature, whether official or otherwise, is lacking
in evidence of the game anywhere in America until introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>into New York City by English officers in garrison in the
eighteenth century. On the contrary, there is proof that,
even as late as 1808/9, the only billiards on Manhattan Island
was the English winning-and-losing game on six-pocket tables,
presumptively from England. One was a 7&nbsp;×&nbsp;14 with eight
legs, and having cushions stuffed with hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probably not worth disputing that, howsoever christened
at first, billiards was originally an outdoor game, and
that, lifted three or four feet from the ground, it was eventually
taken indoors when it rained. Remotely, it may have
been marbles or the immemorially ancient goff (now golf),
or goff may have been remotely billiards or any one of half
a dozen other outdoor jollities. Suffice that billiards to-day
bears no more resemblance to what was so called a century
and a half ago, before France introduced first the third ball
and in 1792 the fourth, than bagatelle bears to shuffleboard
or pingpong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Obscure as that of the game itself is the origin of the
“twist” and the “draw,” the two most important strokes in
modern billiards. England claims them both for John Carr,
the “Bath Marker,” on the ground that, at some time prior
to 1823, he was the first to chalk a cue, which is not a fact;
and France claims them for one Capt. Mingaud, an alleged
professional billiardist, who, while imprisoned for a political
offence in 1823, invented the cue-leather. As the writer
recalls this Mingaudism in its entirety, as published in a book
issued in Paris about 1868 and reprinted in the <i>Billiard Cue</i>
here, it was manifestly pure romance. France may never
have had a professional so named, but France did have a
Capt. Roget de Lisle, who, imprisoned for a political offence
about the beginning of the last century, invented the deathless
“Marseillaise.” Moreover, it was about 1868 that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>writer, on the authority of Prof. Wm. Lake, who was a professional
billiard-player here before and after 1823, published
that Camille Avout, a shoemaker, was the pioneer in turning
out cue-leathers in New York City prior to 1823, in which
year a few were imported from France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further to complicate matters, Carr is called the “father of
the side-stroke” by the renowned Pierce Egan, a contemporary
of Carr, in his “Annals of Sporting,” a London periodical;
while later English billiard writers recount that
Roomkeeper Bartley, Carr’s employer, was the inventor of
the side-stroke and the draw, that in due course he showed
them to his marker, and that Carr merely profited by vending,
as the magical cause of both, some powdered chalk in pillboxes
at two-and-sixpence a box, Italian, French and Spanish
players being his easy customers.</p>

<p class='c007'>No matter when or in what shape billiards had its beginning,
it has been a favorite recreation of the good and the
great for ages, and never more noticeably so than in the
present one. Philosophers seek it, divines commend it, and
physicians prescribe it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever its old form, its new is essentially American.
Other lands have gradually yielded to the force of American
ideas. Public matches were a dozen years old in this country
before there was one in any other, and the American billiard
tournament, never seen in England until 1874/5, and not in
France until 1879, is now the accepted mode in both.</p>

<p class='c007'>Balklining, another American idea, was unknown to the
professionals and amateurs of France until 1880. It is now
their standard caroming restriction, while for seven or eight
years past the English have been urging a line around the
table as a hindrance to the “nursery cannons” that are the
most recent powerful development in their national game.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Cushion-caroms were first publicly exhibited in this country
in 1867, but never in France until 1881. Three-cushion
caroms, of which the Paris professionals have made a specialty
during the past dozen years, constitute another game
of American development, dating from 1878 in a non-public
way among professionals, and going many years further back
among our non-professionals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until the way was shown by Andrew Buist, an American,
caroms were barely an incidental feature of the English game.
Attention was called anew to them by the separate visits the
Dions made to London more than twenty years ago. Even
the prolific spot-ball play, which has likewise been surprisingly
progressive, owes at least a little to this side of the
Atlantic, for in advance of Buist another American—Linley
Higham, the “Albany Pony”—settled in England. Spot-balling,
at which he was mighty for that era on an American
6&nbsp;×&nbsp;12 table, called then for but four different strokes in
England. Now it engages more than twice as many.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modifications have likewise affected the representative
players of France and America. For fifteen years after they
first came together, the French were weak as compound cushioners,
but strong as ball-to-ball drivers. It was the other
way with the Americans, who had been brought up on 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;12
and 5½&nbsp;×&nbsp;11 pocket tables, while the French professors had been
accustoming themselves to what was nearly a 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 carom,
whereon other cushioning than a single one, in which they
were strong and the Americans weak, was an infrequent
necessity. Now that the two nationalities are using the one
table, there is little to choose between them in respect of
cushioning and ball-to-balling. If proof were needed, there
is the international championship match of January 29, 1904,
with its score of 500 to 496, which is both trusty history and
the latest up to date.</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'>Architects, in their plans for modern mansions, should
make suitable provision for this amusement, without
which no gentleman’s establishment (more especially if a
country one) can now be considered perfect. Even if the
builder of a house has no taste for the game himself, he
should look beforehand, and consider that such an accommodation
might form an important item in the price which
a succeeding tenant would be willing to pay for it. The
light, if possible, should come from above, through
ample skylights, so as to bring the table within a general
focus, and thus prevent any shadow being thrown
from the balls or cushions. The gas-light should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>raised about three feet two inches from the bed of the table
and supplied with horizontal burners, as by such an arrangement
no shadow is cast from the pipe. The distance of
the light from the floor should be about 6 feet 1 inch. For
a 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 table the cross-arms of the pendant should measure
from light to light 28 inches, and the long arms 56 inches.
For a 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 table, cross-arms 25 inches, and long arms
50 inches. For a 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 table, cross-arms 22 inches, and
long arms 44 inches. For a 5½&nbsp;×&nbsp;11 table, cross-arms
31 inches, and long arms 62 inches. A useful shade has
been devised which throws a soft, even light on the table,
and keeps the glare from the player’s eyes. The floor,
if carpeted at all, should be covered with some thick, soft
material.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c001'>BILLIARD APPLIANCES—THEIR CHOICE AND CARE.</h3>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c012'>HOW TO SELECT A TABLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Never attempt it. Rather consult with and rely upon
reputable manufacturers.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SIZE, SHAPE, AND STYLE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>In this country there are the standard size, which is 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10
feet, and the popular size, which is 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9. Experts use the
former, and the latter is preferred in many public rooms and
clubs, as well as in most private houses, in the last of which
the 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 also often finds a place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tables are of various styles and shapes, but mostly now
without pockets, and with the broad rails at sides and ends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>beveled, ogee, or square. Those designed for ball-pool have
six pockets usually, but sometimes only four. In addition
there is the combination billiard-table, meant for both caroms
and ball-pool at will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beds are of slate, and their tendency is toward greater
thickness than was required up to a few years ago. This adds
to the general stability of the table. Even for the 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;12,
slabs now are often in three pieces, instead of four, thus insuring
a smoother playing surface. Heavier slabs should
have six legs instead of four, whether the table is 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 or
larger. Many 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9’s have six.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apart from its cloth and cushions, a table requires no
special care beyond treating it similarly to any other piece of
furniture, by keeping its framework clean and occasionally
applying polish, which can be had of almost any furniture-dealer.
When not in use, the table should be well covered up.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE CLOTH.</h4>

<p class='c013'>There are various kinds and several grades. Buying the
best will save money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost invariably, it is the indifferent player or worse who,
in or out of public rooms, finds most fault with cushions,
balls, cues, leathers, or chalk. The experienced one has
learned that usually, when all is not well with him at billiards,
the fault is with himself or in his stroke. A less skillful performer
will blame the balls when a sagging floor has thrown
the table out of level, the table when a ball needs either
truing or a holiday, the chalk or the leather when he is wildly
throwing his whole body at the ball, and the cushion when
diminished speed is really due to the influence of a protracted
spell of damp weather upon cloth or ivory. One is sure to
absorb moisture, and the other may.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>As soon as play is over, and especially in damp weather, the
cloth should first be hair-brushed and then whisk-broomed,
both processes being with the nap. This, on all tables properly
set up, runs in the one direction, although what in
America and elsewhere are called “head” and “foot” become
“bottom” and “top” in England, an inversion whose
effect is to make the grain run the same way in both, the
English starting from the bottom. Whether table be pocket
or carom, the dust is to be swept out through the two corners
farthest from the “string-line,” or “balk,” as it is termed in
Canada, India, England and Australia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beating with the hair-brush is not advisable. Cloth
should not be so long neglected as to need it. The brush
spreads in the pounding, and its action is as much against
the nap as with it.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE CUES.</h4>

<p class='c013'>As to both their selection and their care, players should
trust to the roomkeeper and his staff. An owner of a private
table ought to see that, after play, they are not only kept
away from a heater, but are also stood exactly upright in their
rack, to prevent warping or crooking. Under-leathers sometimes
need sandpapering to overcome expansion. Neglected,
they will wear away the nap of the cloth in low-ball “draw-shots,”
if not make it picturesque with L-shaped rents,
although the usual start of these rents is that the cloth has
been minutely punctured either by a hammered cue-ball
(massé) or by one made acrobatic by an unskillful, thoughtless
stroke as it leaves either the cue or the cushion. For
slightly roughening the surface of the upper leather, solidifying
it, smoothing its edges, and generally “rounding it off”
as a finishing touch, a fine rasp is of service; but it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>not be used without that instruction which any competent
roomkeeper will be glad to give.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a habit with a few to chalk both their bridge-hand
and the upper half of their cues in muggy weather, thereby
befouling their own cloth and that of the table. A wet rag,
followed by a dry one, will remove the stickiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cues are made as light as 12 ounces, but those most in
demand are from 17 to 22.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ball-pool, in calling for a somewhat different stroke from
that of ordinary caroms, needs a little longer cue.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CUE-LEATHERS.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Self-adhesives, with directions accompanying every box,
have made the act of leathering an easy art; but selection is
still a science, and here again, until experience has taught the
amateur not so much, perhaps, what he needs as what he
ought to expect to get, manufacturer or roomkeeper will be
the safer guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same counsel will apply to</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CHALK.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Most on the market is good. Much is often unspeakably
bad. All should be dry, and as free from grease as from grit.
It now comes in various shapes—octagon, cylindrical and
square. As the colored is labor-saving, few roomkeepers have
use for the white. Just as few took to the colored when first
brought to notice, nearly forty years ago, although it was
made green in order not to show itself upon the cloth.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE CUSHIONS.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Elasticity, accuracy and durability are their requisites.
By elasticity is not meant excessive speed, for a cushion can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>be made so fast as utterly to baffle the good player without
ultimately aiding the bad one who craves it. All other things
equal, that cushion is best which is neither radical nor unexpected
in its angles, and is least susceptible to ordinary
atmospheric changes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until their covering begins to wear out in spots, cushions
need no other attention than to be lightly brushed when the
bed-cloth is cleansed, and every few weeks to have their bolts
tightened by the merest turn or fraction. Should the bolts
be overlooked too long, the cushion itself, by emitting a
jingling sound, will give notice that a shrinkage in wood or
metal calls for carpenter’s bit-and-brace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The height of the top of the modern cushion-rail from the
floor, if level, may be roundly expressed as thirty-four inches,
and that of the cushion’s knife-like edge from the bed is one
and seven-sixteenths inches. This is for the regulation
American and French ball, which, at one-quarter of an inch
above its centre, comes into contact with the cushion’s edge.
Struck with force, a much larger ball would jump over the
cushion, while a much smaller, jamming itself between table’s
bed and cushion’s edge, would jump inwardly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cushions must be tuned to balls. Unless the former have
a given height and pitch, there cannot be accurate reflection,
and there may be inaccurate stroke. Height has already been
discussed. Pitch is the inward slant of the cushion’s top
surface as a guide to the cue in certain situations.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE MAGIC BALLS.</h4>

<p class='c013'>With balkline the vogue, as much depends upon balls,
cloth and cushions as upon the player himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Balls should be of well-seasoned ivory, and the only available
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>guarantee as to that is the ability of manufacturers to
carry a heavy stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are players who talk of perfect balls, but a well-turned
ball is the limit, and neither its truing-up nor its recoloring
should ever be intrusted to other than an artisan of
conceded skill and experience. Earth has never known an
absolutely round sphere or a perfectly smooth plane. Under
the glare of a chemical light, lens and screen will show hills and
valleys in both.</p>

<p class='c007'>Requiring much patience and much ivory, matching balls
is an art in itself. The lower end of a tusk is too small for
carom balls, and the upper and larger too hollow. Perhaps
six balls, on an average, can be shaped out of the central
section. The ball toward the smaller end is closer-grained
than any of its companions, all of which, while of the one size,
may differ in other respects from one another. Possibly out
of twenty tusks not fifty balls will be found approximately
equal, in sets of three, with respect to weight and centralized
gravity. As sets, they may all differ from one another, notwithstanding
that any one set is fit for ordinary use; and for
an important match the whole twenty tusks are liable not to
turn out three balls alike in size, weight and central gravity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best and dearest ivory is the rarest—the worst, of
course, is cheapest. Some tusks, as they grow, acquire more
moisture than others. The dentine in the millions of little
cells is greater in one tusk than in another. When it comes
to billiard-balls, what the animal fed upon up to from ten to
twenty years of age, and also where it fed, are no inconsiderable
factors, could we find them out. Some tusks partly
season by sun-drying as they grow, their owners having to
trot long distances for water. Other elephants rear themselves
where water is abundant, but sunshine scarce. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>would also seem to be more durability in the detached tusk
than in balls made from it. The writer has a match-set he
knows to be at least twenty-three years old, that have never
been returned, and that have not had their cardboard box
opened in nearly twenty years. What will happen to them
if put on table? Within four hundred feet of where they rest,
the set used in the Phelan-Seereiter match fell to pieces, in
1867, as soon as played with. As souvenirs they had lain
idle eight years. In Paris, some years later, professors engaged
in a series of games with a set from a tusk (that of a
mammoth) presumably thousands of years old. Until told
the players had no idea but that those balls were from a
modern elephant, born and despoiled within their own lifetime.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view of all this, is it any wonder either that manufacturers
decline to guarantee ivory or that man to-day knows
no more about it and its care than was known two hundred
years ago?</p>

<p class='c007'>Heat is a greater foe to balls than cold. The latter is not
an abstract, positive quality or condition, being merely the
absence of heat. Could excessive warmth be guarded against
as to billiard-balls, there would be little reason to dread the
chilly draught. At the outset, balls need to be much larger in
hot climates than in cold. We in America murmur, and yet
billiards, both social and spectacular, is played in countries
where heat and moisture will change every new set from
sphere to spheroid within a month.</p>

<p class='c007'>Balls usually do their prettiest freaks across the grain, but
sometimes do them with the grain. Those that swell under
the influence of moisture will occasionally, if allowed to
remain idle for months, resume their proper form automatically;
but in a large majority of cases truing-up is the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>cure. Balls that crack will be helped to heal, like human lips
that chap, by touching them somewhat sparingly with tallow.
Neither rubbing balls with oil nor storing them in sawdust
saturated with it is recommended. There are countries
having peculiarly evaporative traits in which oil has been
proved a blessing, but in this climate tallow for cracks and
sawdust without oil are about the limit of cure and prevention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Balls should never be placed on or near a heater. Modern
artificial warmth is ivory’s direst enemy. Roomkeepers meet
with fewer mishaps as to balls when their places are heated
by stoves. Those fresh from play, especially in hot rooms,
should not be placed on metal or stone, nor even on wood
near door or window. Metal and stone are no colder than the
room itself, although feeling colder to the touch; but they
have a wonderful capacity for stealing heat from other things
and giving it away in space, to suck in more. Nor should balls
be put at once into an iron safe. Their play has been work,
and there can be no work without generating inside heat.
The old way was to put them up on a shelf in the open room.
The box might have a lid, but there would be holes in it the
year round. The fire would go out slowly and early, and
zero might come after midnight, but the balls would be there
at 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> sharp. Nails in the floor worried the old-timers,
with their self-ventilating balls, more than heat or cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was their fashion, too, never to put new balls in play at
once. No matter how well-seasoned ivory is in point of age,
it is practically nowhere riper than in its greenest part. Consequently
a ball pared in spots in returning is virtually a new
ball throughout in proffering the atmosphere new access to
its interior. Were new balls put upon the table every day
for two or three weeks, after the chill is off the room, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>merely toyed with, without ever being struck with anything
like force, they would probably give better and longer service.</p>

<p class='c007'>A private table should have two sets of balls, and public
rooms not fewer than three sets to every two carom tables.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as play is done, the balls should be wiped off with
a moist cloth, and then dried and polished with one of wool or
chamois, so fine as not to scratch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Composition balls have advantages besides their cheapness,
but the demand for them continues to be almost confined in
this country to ball-pool. The prejudice against them for
caroms is still, as it was thirty-six years ago, that they are not
ivory. The interval has greatly improved them, however,
and this year’s promise of “absolute perfection” may at least
result in coming closer to it than ever before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The match-standard American carom-ball, always of ivory,
is of 2⅜ diameter, with the red no larger than the whites.
Standard ones for ordinary use are, when new, either 2⅜
full or 2<span class='fraction'>7<br /><span class='vincula'>16</span></span> scant.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MANUAL.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In billiards first impressions form no inconsiderable
bearing upon the future practice, and success depends,
to a considerable extent, whether these impressions be
good or bad, true or false. Too often one endeavoring
to learn without the aid of an instructor falls into error
through a misunderstanding of the first principles, or
a disregard for them, in efforts to accomplish the desired
ends, by means which at the moment appear the
readiest, but are liable, in the majority of cases, to be at
variance, and opposed to the laws governing the principle.
Repetitions of this fault create a habit, and the
player, finding his game does not show the satisfactory
improvement he has reason to expect, seeks a remedy in
an instructor who, seeing the false ideas governing his
pupil’s movements, is forced to rid him of all that he has
acquired, and recommence upon an entirely new basis.
All know the difficulty of changing at once the ideas
which have been long entertained, even though one is
satisfied of their falsity; and to avoid this it is better, when
possible, to start in a proper manner, secure a competent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>teacher, and accustom one’s self to the proper mode of
play in the beginning. A teacher, to be valuable, should
be able not only to show how the stroke is to be made,
but to make it and tell why the effect is produced and
how, to give the reasons for the different motions, and,
in fact, to understand the philosophy as well as the practice
of the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>There have been published some fifty or more volumes
upon the game of billiards, in English, French, and German,
and despite this number the remark has often been
made that one cannot learn to execute well from a book.
This, to a great extent, has been the fault of the authors,
who have been obscure in their meanings, have not
shown the <i>simple</i> reasons why each particular description
of stroke is made, and have indulged too much in
perplexing fractions and algebraic problems, or else they
have reached the opposite extreme, and give no particulars
other than how to strike the ball, and what the result
will be after it is so struck. It has been the desire and
effort of the writer to make the following directions and
diagrams so plain and comprehensible that any one, by
the exercise of ordinary care, can learn to play billiards
<i>well</i>, by following them, and the finished player may be
able to learn something further by a study of these pages.
But, in order that this end may be attained, the player is
urged to follow the teachings <i>implicitly</i>, and where his
own views may be in conflict with those herein expressed,
he should discard them and conform strictly
with those found hereafter. Every diagram and example
in this volume has been carefully tested, and if the
stroke is made as required, the result is <i>inevitably</i> as set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>forth; should it fail, the player will discover some divergence
on his part from the instruction.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>ATTITUDE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The acquisition of a good attitude is a point of the
first importance to the student of billiards, and yet, from
its purely physical nature, is a subject which almost defies
the control of any written rules. There are peculiarities
of height and figure which render the rules that
would be excellent in one case totally inapplicable in the
other; thus it is impossible to define by inches the distance
at which a player should stand from the table,
when about to strike; for not only will the different
statures of men cause a difference of position—but, even
with the same player, different positions of the ball will
call for corresponding changes of attitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these circumstances, the best that can be done
is to give a general direction, which each student must
apply for himself to his own particular case. Let him
stand with his left foot slightly advanced, his left arm
extended and resting on the table to form a bridge, and
his body, not facing the table squarely, but forming an
acute angle with the side at which he stands; let him
relax all the muscles of his limbs into their usual and
most natural posture—for rigidity of body is at all times
awkward and ungraceful, and seriously interferes with
play. The striking motion should be confined to the
wrist and arm, and chiefly to the lower division of it;
athletes in billiards, or those persons who throw their
bodies forward after the cue, would do well to renounce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the “game,” for that quality totally unfits them for the
delicacy of touch and firmness of body, eye, and purpose,
which are the grand essentials of success. The
body should remain immovable as a rock, while the right
arm swings to and fro at a sufficient distance to avoid
contact with the side, when advancing. All spasmodic
motion and muscular contortions should be avoided;
mere bodily strength in the player will not give strength
to his stroke; the quantity of motion imparted to the
ball will correspond precisely with the weight of the cue
multiplied by the velocity with which it is advancing
at the instant of contact; and therefore the only force
required from the player, even for the strongest stroke,
is force enough to cause his cue to move forward at a
rate of speed which, multiplied by its gravity, will give
the required result. As said, this motion should emanate
especially from the wrist and forearm. It is impossible
to describe exactly what should be conveyed;
but if the readers, when striking, will imagine that
they are throwing a lasso, and give the same quick,
steady force of wrist to the cue that is required in
flinging the coil, they will understand exactly what is
required.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is owing to the knowledge of this secret, that men,
physically weak, are frequently more than a match in
billiard-strength for players who have the proportions
of Hercules, and the “dead pull” of Samson when he
brought down the pillars of the temple on the heads of
the assembled heathen.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for the attitude in which a lady should stand while
playing billiards, no instruction is needed; perfect ease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>is perfect grace, and perfect ease of position is the grand
<span class='fss'>DESIDERATUM</span> for the billiard-player. As the ladies are
always graceful, they will naturally observe that ease of
attitude which it is only necessary to enforce upon the
ruder and more awkward sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>The male novice should avoid all stiffness and parade—all
affected dignity. Let the dress and attitude be
such as to afford the body a perfect mastery of its own
movements. A practised eye can discriminate at the first
glance, on entering a billiard-room, which is the really
skillful player, and which the pretentious bungler, by
merely noting the contrast which the good player’s easy
grace presents to the rigid formalism of the other. Paganini,
in his younger days, when he taught the violin,
used to give his pupils six months time in which to practise
how to hold the instrument and bow. When they
understood that thoroughly, he could teach them, he
said, the remainder of the art in a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, without requiring so long an apprenticeship—without,
in fact, requiring any at all—if the student will
only allow himself to stand in his natural position, the first
essential feature of the game will have been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The left foot should be pushed slightly forward, pointing
straight ahead, while the right is withdrawn, and
turned outward, at whatever angle is habitual and most
convenient to the player. The body should be fairly
balanced, for, without this equilibrium, we can neither
have grace nor ease. The left arm, when necessary,
should be advanced and rested on the table—the left
hand being extended, as in the cut, to form a “bridge.”
(See page <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h4 class='c014'>SELECTION OF A CUE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Select a cue in harmony with the physical powers, and
become accustomed so much as possible to play with
cues of similar weight. From fifteen to nineteen ounces
are fair weights, according to the balls now used in play.
A cue, if too heavy, will paralyze the nerves of the arm
and render them unable to estimate correctly the amount
of force employed; if too light, on the other hand, it will
call for an amount of force so great as to be incompatible
with a steady and deliberate aim. Without some sensation
communicated to the hand through the cue, when
it contacts with the ball, it would be impossible for experts
to accomplish the great runs so often made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heavier the cue the less is the influence of the
stroke on the ball felt, and it is carried beyond or falls
short of the point desired. The delicate touch for nursing
should be as apparent as the stronger stroke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, let the cue be straight, for any crookedness in
this instrument distracts the eye, and may seriously interfere
with the manual correctness.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CUE-LEATHERS.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The leather is an important feature of the cue—in fact,
an all-important one to any player who deals much in
the strokes which are technically described as “forcing,”
“twisting,” and “following.” With an inferior leather,
his play will be paralyzed by miscues. In selecting the
cue-leather, choose such as possess the finest fibre, and
are at the same time solid, pliable, and elastic; and see
to it that they have a good, solid under-leather, as that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>will save the point of the cue from breaking away, and
will last longer than a thin one. Before being fitted on
to the cue, they should be thoroughly well beaten out on
a lapstone, so as to prevent them from spreading in the
course of play; but that side of them which is next the
cue should be roughened with a file or sandpaper, as also
the cue itself, in order that the adhesive wax may be able
to take good hold. The leather should be rounded, not
flat, yet each must decide for himself the exact degree of
convexity which will best suit his play. When the point
of the leather becomes glazed from excessive play, a little
sandpaper should be used to roughen it, so that the
chalk may stick.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>HOW TO HOLD THE CUE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The cue should be held lightly in the hand, and when
the tip rests one-eighth of an inch from the ball the cue-hand
will be found beneath but a trifle forward of the
elbow. This assures near a horizontal stroke, whereas
if the cue be held at the extreme end of the butt, a
curved motion up and down is given it in making the
stroke. The cue is to be held by the three fingers and
thumb, bent about it for support. When the stroke
is given, and the cue carried forward, the hand closes
naturally and without effort on the part of the player,
then as the cue is drawn back the hand opens and is
found again as described. The hand is not closed upon
the cue until the instant the ball is struck, when it is
done instinctively; the strength of this grasp being governed
by the quickness of the movement. The speed of
the cue, rather than the weight of the body or the greatness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of muscle, gives force to the ball. At the instant of
aim being perfected the stroke should be made, and he
who has the faculty of quickest perception and calculation
will become the finest player.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>AIM AND DELIVERY.</h4>

<p class='c013'>To determine the line of aim let the bridge hand be
raised or lowered as may be made necessary for the delivery
of the cue, care being taken to elevate the butt as
little as possible, thus permitting the cue to rest nearly
horizontal. In changing the height of the bridge hand
do not allow the end of the thumb to rise or fall, separated
from the forefinger, against which it should rest
gently, but secure the proper height by raising or lowering
the palm of the hand from the table, permitting the
weight to come upon the heel of the hand and the ends
of the fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In preparing for the stroke many things must be considered;
the strength to be employed, the chances for a
“kiss,” the weight of the ball and cue, the probable position
for the succeeding carom, and the more important
matter of all, the exact spot upon the cue-ball to be hit
with the cue-point.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, resolve upon the direction of aim, then the point
on the cue-ball for receiving the cue; let the eye rise to
the spot of contact on the object-ball, and instantly upon
being satisfied the calculations are correct make the
stroke. At the moment the cue strikes the cue-ball the
eye should shift to the object-ball, as with the marksman
who regards the target rather than his rifle, in shooting.
In moving the cue backward and forward to secure aim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>let its point each time come within one-eighth of an inch
of the ball, being careful, of course, not to make a foul.
Some players do not permit the cue to approach nearer
the ball than an inch, and at that distance a stroke false
to the calculation is most certain to result. The beginner
should not be discouraged by the result of a stroke
which he may have reasoned to himself was perfect.
Whatever the intentions may have been before making
it, the course of the ball will show beyond doubt the
stroke that was <i>actually</i> made, and the player will then
understand, if that course be different than he anticipated,
that the point of contact upon the cue-ball was
not such as he intended; he must remember, in fact,
that the laws of motion are unalterable, while human
vision is easily deceived.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>THE CUE-BALL.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The centre of the cue-ball being considered the point
from which all calculations are made, the following words
are used in the directions for making shots to express a
stroke at fractional distances from this centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>The centre, as presented to player in a horizontal stroke:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Above</i> means above centre.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Below</i> means below centre.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Right</i> means right of centre.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Left</i> means left of centre.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h5 class='c014'><i>Massé Stroke.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>The centre, as the player looks down upon the ball:</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Aft</i> means off the perpendicular centre, directly away from the
object-ball looking from <i>above</i>, in direction of the line of aim.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Forward</i> means forward of centre toward object-ball.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Right</i> means right of centre from line of aim.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<img src='images/i_028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Diagram illustrating a stroke of the cue which imparts the four primary motions to the ball.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><i>Left</i> means left of centre from line of aim.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>The cue-ball</i> is that with which the play is made.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>The object-ball</i> is the first ball struck by the cue-ball.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>The carom-ball</i> is the second ball struck by the cue-ball, completing
the carom.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is first necessary to master the centre-stroke, which
is accomplished by delivering the cue at the point <i>g</i>, the
line <i>g</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>a</i>, being the centre diameter of the ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>The centre stroke imparts to the ball a <i>natural</i> impelling
force where the strength of stroke is not in excess of
“ordinary” (see Plate I). This stroke should always be
used unless the player has a <i>reason</i> for a different delivery.
Any divergence from the centre produces an effect on
the ball in excess of the natural, and when applied in the
smallest degree the result should be fully understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>A centre stroke, with exceeding strength, produces an
effect herein explained:</p>

<p class='c007'>A centre stroke, slow or medium, will cause the cue-ball
to rotate the instant of delivery, but in excess of medium
the ball will slide a distance over the cloth before
rotating, that distance being governed by the strength of
stroke, and when thus sliding should contact be had with
an object ball, at the slightest variation from its centre,
right or left, the cue-ball will perform a right angle to
either side, and the object-ball, taking up the impelling
force, continues the direct right line of the cue-ball.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><i>The Follow-Stroke.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>By viewing the diagram in such way as will bring the
explanation under letter A into a proper reading position,
the follow shot is seen. For this stroke the cue is
delivered ½ above centre, imparting two forces to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>ball: impelling it forward in direction of arrow a and
rotating in direction of arrow b, the entire force of the
blow converging to centre of motion <i>e</i>. With this stroke
the cue-ball, after striking the object-ball <i>full</i>, follows
<i>directly</i> in its path. At the instant of impact with an object-ball,
the cue-ball will, if struck with great strength,
apparently stand still through the resistance of opposite
forces caused by contact, but the rotating power overcoming
the repelling tendency of the concussion, carries
it forward on its original path.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noticed the line <i>k</i> through the cue meets the
spot <i>h</i> on the ball which is the point of aim, and this
should be the case in every description of stroke. Only
a part of the surface of the leather impinges upon the
ball in this stroke, and the quantity of surface is governed
by the strength used, for the stronger the blow the
greater the indentation of the ball in the leather. The
effect of delivering the cue-ball on the object-ball right
or left of full will become apparent to the student early in
his practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cue may be delivered still farther above the
centre—a ⅝ delivery, which imparts excessive rotation,
and which is as far above as the leather will hold on
the ball surface. The “follow” can also be executed
with the cue delivered as far as one-fourth below centre,
but the latter delivery should be with a “slow” strength
of stroke, that the ball may rotate naturally; if it be
<i>full</i> upon the object-ball and with strength exceeding
“medium,” the cue-ball will stop, or will perform a right
angle if played a fraction off the centre, as shown in
Plate IV., Balls 1 and 6.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h5 class='c014'><i>The Draw-Stroke.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Turn the diagram so the letter B may come beneath
it and the draw-shot is illustrated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delivery as shown is one-half below centre, with
the central line <i>k</i> through cue meeting the point of contact,
<i>h</i>, on ball, and imparting to it three distinct forces,
that of impulsion, rotation, and retrograde, the latter
causing the cue-ball to rotate in direction of the arrow <i>b</i>;
the strength of this force is such as to counteract the
natural tendency of the impulsion, prevent the forward
rotation, and cause the ball thereby to slide over the
cloth without the rolling motion. This stroke holds the
ball (thus preventing for the instant its natural rotation)
in a position corresponding with the line <i>e</i> to <i>i</i>, the moment
the impelling force is communicated to the object-ball,
which is at the instant of contact, the retrograde
power acts with all its <i>remaining</i> strength, and it returns
in the direction of the player. The distance between the
balls must regulate the strength of the stroke, but greater
distance between cue- and object-ball requires greater
force, that the cue-ball may retain its retrograde tendency
which prevents its being displaced by friction in sliding
over the cloth, which inertia in the cue-ball acts in the
direction of dotted line <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>. A delivery ½ below, with
the object-ball the length of the table away, will act as a
“slowed” ball only. The quick, sudden delivery movement
of the cue made with the aid of the wrist is what
imparts the retrograde or “draw” tendency to the ball;
there should be no spasmodic motion, but a free and
horizontal blow direct at the calculated spot on the surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of the cue-ball, permitting the cue to pass naturally
beyond where the cue-ball has rested, as the grip of the
hand upon the cue will stop the latter when the limit of
its swing is reached, except where cue- and object-balls
are near together; in the latter case, that a foul may be
avoided, a “twist” or “English” is imparted to the cue-ball,
which carries the cue naturally off the side of the
cue-ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not withdraw the cue; it is an awkward habit many
persons have acquired. The limit of the swing of the cue is
governed by the strength of the stroke. Full instructions
in regard to the cue and its delivery have already been
given.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><i>The “English” or “Twist”-Stroke.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>Bringing C beneath the diagram, we have the “English”
stroke, with the cue delivered at ½ right of centre, which
imparts to the cue-ball a perpendicular axis. A variation
to the slightest degree in twist makes a difference in the
direction of the cue-ball, which can only be appreciated
by those who have studied it carefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>A player, when instructed to deliver a ⅛ cue-ball, for
instance, will disregard the direction and deliver a ¼ or
even a ½ ball, apparently unconscious or careless of the
value of the change. When it is understood that a cue-ball
may be made to carom upon a ball placed <i>anywhere</i>
upon the bed of the table by the application of the proper
degree of twist, then the player will recognize the necessity
or advisability of so fixing the various degrees in his
mind as to have them always ready for use. A twist secures,
of course, a <i>false</i> angle, and is used generally when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the natural angle will not accomplish the result desired,
and again, often is employed to control the object-ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>The velocity of the cue-ball in the twist-stroke is
governed by the divergence from the centre at which
delivery of cue is made. There is a method in employing
twist which is effective, that of combining it with the
division of the object- and cue-balls, giving an exact line
of aim to be had in no other way. When the twist is
applied to that side of the cue-ball coming in contact
with the object-ball, the aim will be more positive, as the
cue covers the exact line of aim through the two balls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of the twist may be marked by placing the
cue-ball upon its spot, and playing the cue-ball, hit in its
centre, at the left side cushion, at an angle of 45°. The
ball in its rebound taking a natural angle, traverses a line
corresponding to its original line of departure from the
cue. Impart right-hand English and the angle grows obtuse;
increase the twist and the angle widens accordingly,
and it grows until the extreme angle is reached
through application of excessive twist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Players frequently are at a loss to know upon which
side to apply twist to accomplish certain desired results,
and but few give sufficient thought to the matter to understand
the theory of the “English.” A cue-ball struck
upon its right side and contacting with the left cushion
at an angle of 45°, the cue-ball touching cushion at point
<i>l</i> on ball (see p. <a href='#Page_44'>44</a>), will describe an obtuse or wide angle,
which is nearer parallel to the cushion than the natural
angle, for the reason that the circular spinning motion,
imparted by the cue to the ball, is moving on that side
of the ball contacting with cushion in an opposite direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to the impelling force (as shown in arrows <i>b</i> and <i>l</i>);
hence, when it contacts with the cushion, it spins against
it in a direction which acts as a blow from the ball on the
cushion, and this carries it farther forward. When the reverse
or left English is imparted the revolution of the ball
is exactly opposite to that already shown, and its tendency
is to leave the cushion toward an acute angle, the direction
of the spin on the side contacting being that in which the
ball is moving; so, when it meets the cushion, in place of
gliding along it strikes it in such a manner as to receive
a check to further onward progress and describes a line
inclined toward a right angle from the point of contact.</p>

<p class='c007'>When delivered directly upon a cushion the cue-ball
should be struck upon that side toward which it is expected
to roll. In compound angles the twist is so consumed
after leaving the second cushion that the response
from a third cushion approximates a natural angle. Many
players are deluded with the idea that it is necessary to
turn, jerk, or twist the arm when making an “English”
stroke, and some suppose the ball should be rubbed by
the cue in delivery; in reality no such thing is required.
After the aim is secured, and the point for striking is determined
upon, let the player make the stroke naturally
and easily, and leave everything else to take care of itself.
After the blow has been given, no amount of intelligence
and no wonderful contortions can alter its effects. In all
deliveries imparting twist up to and including “ordinary”
strength of stroke, the wrist only is to be used. Every
blow delivered with the cue converges to the centre of
motion at <i>e</i> in the cue-ball (as shown in arrow <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>,), and
every grain of weight in the ball is imparted through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>cue to the hand; therefore with the expert the weight
and density of the ball is calculated to a nicety at each
delivery, whether it be at centre or at ⅝ right or left,
else all strengths could not be so cleverly estimated in
gathering and holding the balls for a long run.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><i>The Massé.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>Bringing the letter D beneath the illustration the
massé stroke is shown.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the most difficult of all strokes to describe and
instruct with the pen. The cue is delivered in the diagram
at the ½ ball surface-point <i>h</i>; the cue is held slanting
at an angle of 78¾ degrees, shown by dotted line
<i>d</i>. The butt of the cue is held as near the eye as
is possible, not interfering with the sight, that the eye
may run down the cue covering the spot on the ball
to be hit; the cue is held between the thumb and three
fingers, the thumb being on that side toward the face,
and when the point of the cue rests on the ball the
thumb of this cue-hand should be about three inches
above the horizontal line of the elbow of that arm; this
will show the spot on the cue-ball which is to be struck.
Permit the cue to play freely and without diverging from
a straight line in its movement up and down, to and from
the ball, until the aim is secured.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
<img src='images/i_036.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>The bridge is formed by resting the ends of the fingers
of the bridge-hand on the table with a slight pressure,
the back of the hand being turned outward nearly parallel
with the side of the body, with the fingers slightly
spread to resist vibration from the play of the cue, with
the thumb separated from the hand, with its end resting
about an inch and a half from the forefinger. The spot
upon the ball for delivery of the cue must be found by
looking between the thumb and forefinger, immediately
over the outer edge of the cue-tip. Practise this position
as instructed, and when it is acquired more than
half the difficulties of the stroke will be overcome. It is
this correct attitude that goes far toward insuring a
proper delivery of the cue-tip on the cue-ball. For deliveries
in excess of “medium” the cue may be held at
the butt, the same as heretofore instructed for the
regular massé, with the exception that the left forearm
must rest upon the hip, the forefinger hooked
about the cue a foot more or less from the tip. In this
way unlimited strength may be used. In the close massé
the weight of the cue, guided by the wrist only, is sufficient
to accomplish the stroke. The forearm is used in
addition to the wrist when the balls lie farther apart,
judgment, of course, being exercised in imparting the
force in accordance with the distance between cue- and
object-ball. When the delivery is perfect, the bite or
grasp of the cue-tip on the ball will be felt in the hand
by the player through a sensitive, keen vibration of the
cue. The retrograde movement imparted to the cue-ball
is that denoted by arrow <i>b</i>, and the slant given the
cue, indicated by dotted line <i>d</i>, imparts the impelling
force and the ball moves in accordance with the calculation.
The cue-ball slides upon the cloth at point <i>a</i>, the
same as explained in the draw-stroke.</p>

  <h5 class='c014'><i>Slowed Ball.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Slowing the cue-ball and speeding the object-ball is
one of the most important strokes in the game. If the
cue-ball be delivered at the pivot centre of the object-ball,
the points of impact will be at the greatest diameter
of both balls and the exact centres of each ball will meet,
and the cue-ball, if hit ¼ below, will stop instantly and
rest. If the cue-ball be delivered a hair’s-breadth from
the centre of the object-ball, the former will describe a
perfect right angle from the object-ball, as illustrated in
Plate IV., balls 1 and 6. The fractional divergences
from centre in delivery of cue on cue-ball gives that ball
a separate and distinct action.</p>

<p>Diagram giving the degrees of elevation at which the cue should be held.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The angle line 10° represents the position of cue in
making the “draw-jump” shot, the stroke “very hard”
⅝  below centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>The angle 22½° is for the “jump stroke,” struck ¼
above the centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>67½° is the “half-massé,” ½ aft the perpendicular or
top centre, as hereafter explained under “Massés.”</p>

<p class='c007'>78¾° is the full massé, the cue-ball being struck ½ aft
the perpendicular centre, i.e., looking down from a line
above the ball at 90°, at the top centre of the ball, which
latter centre is directly over the centre of motion, and
the centre of gravity as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The common angle—45°—is denoted by a heavy line
whereby the player may better gauge the other lines.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><i>The “Jump”: its Causes and Preventions.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>A ball is made to “jump” by being struck hard ¼ above
its centre with the cue held at an elevation of 22½°. The
stroke of the cue at this elevation is resisted by the bed
of the table, and the ball rebounds, leaves the table and
flies through the air, the distance being regulated by the
strength of stroke, which is usually “hard.” When the
cue-ball reaches the object-ball or cushion, its centre is
above that of the object-ball or the top surface of the
cushion, causing the ball to ride over whatever it may contact
with. If the force used is great the object-ball will
also be made to “jump,” often causing both balls to fall
to the floor. When a ball lies close under the cushion it
makes necessary an elevation of the cue to about the angle
for a “jump;” when this occurs the player must be very
careful in making the stroke, and must sacrifice a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>quantity of strength in order to secure the carom, for
should considerable force be used the ball will leave the
bed of the table. When the ball lies in the open table
and it is desirable to use more than “ordinary” strength,
it is always better to deliver the cue ½ below centre, so as
to do away with any possibility of a “jump.” The motion
of the ball in being struck below centre is denoted by the
arrow <i>b</i>, the bed of the table being <i>j</i>, and when contacting
with the cushion at <i>a</i> the ball is rolling upward, and the
cushion acting against it holds it down to the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>In delivering cue on ball, it is always necessary to observe
the exact fractional divergence from centre, as the
slightest change may make the stroke a miss. For the
fractional parts of balls, the reader is referred to the next
succeeding pages.</p>

<h5 class='c014'><i>Object-Ball.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>In the object-ball all distance is measured from its
central width (indicated in cut by dotted line <i>a</i>) to
its outer edge surface, and the fractional strokes are calculated
from this centre point, each divergence denoting
the body resistance received by the cue-ball from the object-ball;
thus with <span class='fraction'>8<br /><span class='vincula'>8</span></span> as a <i>full</i> ball, ⅞ signifies ⅛ to left
or right of centre as may be instructed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position which the object-ball may assume after
being struck is unimportant, <i>so far as that particular
stroke is concerned</i>; but in the management of the balls
and the ability to leave them in a position favorable to
the next play—or unfavorable to his opponent, if the
player thinks it impossible to count himself—lies the
strength and science of the game.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spots on the horizontal line through the centre
diameter of the ball, are the different fractional parts at
which the cue-ball may be delivered, to effect certain results.
The spots are made by exact measurement, and
extend from the pivot A toward either side surface. The
centre A indicates a “dead full” delivery. The spots
right and left of this centre show the points of impact
for the cue-ball, as may be directed.</p>

  <h5 class='c014'><i>Division of the Cue and Object Balls.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The division of the cue and object balls are important
elements in the game of billiards for the player to understand
and master. Both should be divided at the instant
of aim, and the line of aim should be through the
points on the two balls at which they will come in contact.
If a delivery on the object-ball of a ½ ball right
be required, then the left half of the cue-ball will impinge
upon the right half of the object-ball; consequently aim
should be taken from and to these parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to deliver a <i>full</i> cue-ball on a ½ or
other fractional part of an object-ball; for when a full
cue-ball delivery is made upon a full object-ball, the centres
of both balls meet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dotted lines show the course the object-ball takes
after being struck by the cue-ball. These directions may
be considered in effecting either a carom, or in pocketing
the ball in the pool games.</p>

<p class='c007'>The line from <i>a</i> upon the cue-ball to <i>a</i> upon the object-ball
indicates the direction taken by the former when
delivered full upon the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The corresponding letters upon the two balls denote
the points of contact. Thus, the letter <i>b</i> on the cue-ball
shows the point of fractional division of a ¾ ball, and
<i>b</i> upon the object-ball indicates exactly where such a delivery
will bring the cue-ball into contact with it; the
other fractions are at <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dotted lines <i>beyond</i> the object-ball are the paths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>over which it will travel after being struck by the cue-ball
at the fractional deliveries indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>These balls can, of course, be still further divided into
other fractions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>When “English” or “twist” is applied to the cue-ball in its
course, it is forced from a straight line and diverges to an extent
that it will pass around a ball placed in a direct line before it.
The line of aim in the diagram is a ½ ball right on the object-ball,
cue-ball ⅝ left and ⅝ below; stroke, “medium.” This
stroke is the application of the extreme English and extreme
draw, and is of such force as permits the combined motions—impelling,
rotating, retrograde, and diagonal—applied to the cue-ball
to act upon it. The distance from the starting-point of the
greatest point of divergence of a cue-ball is, of course, governed
by the strength of stroke applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The point <i>e</i> is the natural destination of the cue-ball struck at
centre, upon ½ object-ball, and the difference in space between
points <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> may be made by striking the ball, as shown in the
diagram, for the reason that the cue-ball, diverging as it does
from a straight line, takes from the point <i>e</i> a new direction, effecting
a ½ stroke upon the object-ball and rolling, as we have said,
to point <i>f</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dotted line <i>d</i> shows the direction in which the ball is forced
by being struck on the side, but the ball rotating in the opposite
direction to that which it is impelled, in consequence of the twist
and draw imparted, aided by the resistance through friction of
the nap of the cloth, serves to bring it back to the original point
of aim, as shown by the curved loop-line, <i>b</i>, which denotes twist.</p>

<p class='c013'>The letters A, B, C, D, and E, on the diagram opposite, show
the position of the <i>spots</i> on the billiard-table. In placing them a
line is drawn down the centre of the bed, from and to the middle
nails or sights in the head and lower cushions; another line is then
drawn from the centre sights in the <i>side</i> cushions, across the table,
and where the lines intersect the spots are placed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spot at A, being next the head of the table, is, in the American
or four-ball game, the light red spot, and an imaginary line
(G) across the table at this point is the <i>string</i>; the spot at B is the
dark red spot; that at D is the white ball spot. The spot at C is
the English spot, which is twelve and a half inches from the <i>end</i> or
lower cushion, and is used in playing the English game, but in
this country it is generally put about nine inches from the lower
cushion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spot at D is used in two-ball pool, also, and is placed about
five inches from the lower cushion.</p>

<p class='c007'>E shows the pin-pool spots, that in the centre being numbered
five; each of the others should be placed three inches from it, in
position shown, and measuring from the centre of each spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>F shows the position of the balls in playing fifteen-ball pool.
The balls are placed in a triangular frame so as to insure exactness—the
base of the triangle being parallel with the end or lower
cushion of the table. The highest number, fifteen, should be
placed on the deep red spot at B.</p>

<p class='c007'>Figures 1 and 2 show the positions of the semicircles or playing
points for the English and three-ball games.</p>

<p class='c007'>In playing the English game, the semicircle is drawn from the
white ball spot with a radius of ten and one-half to eleven and one-half
inches. In England the spot is placed two feet four and one-half
inches from the cushion on the English 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;12 table.</p>

<p class='c007'>The semicircle for the three-ball game is drawn with a radius of
six inches on the American table.</p>

<p class='c007'>In playing the three-ball game, the spot A is occupied by
the white ball, and the spot B by the red. The semicircle 1 is
drawn six inches from A, and from within this limit the cue-ball
must be delivered in opening the game.</p>

such manner that every stroke when completed shall leave another
to follow.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Directions.</span>—The cue-ball is placed about three inches from
either side of the white spotted ball. In this diagram the
left side is employed. When the stroke is <i>perfectly</i> made
the course of the balls and position left, will approximate the
dotted lines, and at the spots <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, and <i>d</i>. With the ordinary
player, perhaps, the success of the carom will alone be sufficient,
regardless of which side the carom-ball is struck by the
cue-ball. In this diagram at the finish of the stroke the object-balls
are in front of the cue-ball for the succeeding stroke,
whereas the result generally produced from this opening carom
is to place the cue-ball <i>between</i> the others. When one perfects
himself at the opening stroke, which can only be done
with practice, the direction of the cue and object balls will be
easily mastered. The strength of stroke must also be carefully
considered and studied.</p>

This stroke is played as a half follow, in order to gain the
position, although the carom can be easily effected by playing
on ball 1, ¼ right, but this would spread them beyond position
for the succeeding stroke. The course and final resting-place
of the different object-balls are indicated in all the diagrams

“medium,” caroming on ball 2. A follow stroke. To insure
the cue-ball being held on its proper course, it is struck by the
cue just enough left of the centre to prevent the opposite
twist taking effect through carelessness; for if the cue-ball
be struck <i>at all</i> to the right of centre, it will not follow the
line laid out for it. Forearm and wrist motion only required
in this stroke.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Diagram 3.</i>—Cue-ball ½ below, <i>exact</i>, object-ball ⅞ left; stroke,

the curved line of the cue-ball as it leaves the object-ball, and
allow for this curve in calculation.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—That the balls may be placed <i>exact</i> upon the table according to the
diagrams, the author suggests that the student follow the plan here given: First
refer to the diagram desired for practice. If it be the one herewith (No. XVII.),
in order to place ball 2 of diagram 1, draw the direct right lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> from the
centre of ball 2 to the nearest cushion surface at <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, or from the points <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> to
centre of ball 2. On the point where the lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> intersect, place ball 2. In this
manner the student may place any ball <i>exact</i> in position that may be found in
either of the plates in this work. To calculate correctly the spot for the placing
of a ball, note carefully the distance from the <i>nearest</i> diamond sights, at either
<i>nearest</i> cushion, to the point where each line joins the cushion surface, which
will be immediately opposite the exact centre of the ball which is to be placed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natural line of departure from the object-ball, if the cue-ball
be struck centre at a ⅝ ball as stated, would be on the first
cushion, to the right of the heavy line indicated, or at spot <i>c</i>;
this, of course, would govern the point of contact with the second
cushion, and result in missing the carom. The use of the twist,
however, gives it the direction calculated more or less acute than
natural.</p>

<p class='c007'>The twist given the cue-ball is imparted, to some extent, to the
object-ball in impact, causing it to take the proper angles to gather
as desired. By some writers and theorists this statement is disputed,
but repeated experiments have shown it to be a fact beyond
question.</p>

<p class='c007'>The caroms illustrated could be effected by striking the cue-ball
centre, and contacting the object-ball nearer full; but in order to
bring this object-ball into position for next stroke, the twist is applied,
and the natural angle is sacrificed for a <i>false</i> one, in order to
control the object-ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the cue is delivered below the centre of the cue-ball, with the
object-ball 1 touching the cushion, the cue-ball will rebound at an
acute angle that generally fails to effect the carom. The objective
point is the cushion at <i>b</i>, which insures the stroke, and if the angle
be always calculated from a point on the second cushion with
the cue-ball so delivered as to reach that spot, the remainder of the
stroke is assured and will take care of itself. That is to say, draw
the angle required from the object-ball to the first cushion, then
from that point to the second cushion.</p>

  <h2 id='TOURNAMENTS' class='c005'>CONDUCTING TOURNAMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Finding the Number of Games.</span>—The first thing to
know is the number of games imposed by differing numbers
of entries. There are several ways of working this out. The
quickest and simplest is a mental one. If the number of
entries is even, say 10, multiply the second highest term (9)
by one-half the highest—9&nbsp;×&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;45. If odd, as 7, multiply
that figure by one-half the next highest—7&nbsp;×&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;21 games.
But, if a pencil is handy, a quick enough way is to multiply
the highest term, whether odd or even, by the next highest,
and then divide the product by 2, which will show 253 games
if there are 23 entries—23&nbsp;×&nbsp;22 506, halved. These are
regular games. No amount of figuring can forecast ties.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tie Games.</span>—When competition is for a championship,
any tie for it must be played off. Ties for other prizes may
or may not be, as circumstances dictate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tie Games Separate.</span>—Save when they involve a championship,
tie games are no part of the tournament proper,
which ordinarily ends when all the contestants have either
played or forfeited an equal number of games. Yet, while
tie games for else than the championship will not serve to
determine other than special wagers, they are, nevertheless,
records in themselves, although without being a part of the
tournament.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Forfeitures.</span>—In a tournament, every game begins with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the first one, in the sense of binding every player who has not
previously been declared out. It has always been an unwritten
law of billiards that a withdrawer, instead of canceling
his games already played, forfeits those he has yet to
play. The former procedure penalizes the faultless for
another’s fault. It is also open to the objection that, in
order to deprive one winner of his record for high average or
high run, the loser of the game in which either was made may
be induced to withdraw. Injustice is possible even without
collusion. Within two years, cancellation has deprived one
continuing player of his highest average, and another of the
highest average of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>For amateur tournaments, a few Western roomkeepers
have a rule of their own, which cancels if the withdrawer has
not played more than half his games, and forfeits if he has.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Guarding Against Forfeiture or Other Failure.</span>—Until
a scheduled game is started, the players of the next one
in order should be on hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Sanctity of Schedule.</span>—A schedule once made out
by due authority should be adhered to, instead of being
changed to suit some individual caprice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Opening Game.</span>—Never let it be between the supposed
best two players. For some special reason, one such may be
utilized, but not two without inviting the almost certain
penalty of a loss of public interest as the games draw near
their close.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rush the Losers.</span>—As far as practicable, play losers first
in preference to winners. If they are good losers, they will
not object. In no other way can the anti-climax be prevented
of having one or more games to play after the main
prize has been won, or of requiring the leader to play when
there is nothing for him to win.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span><span class='sc'>Handicapping.</span>—This, so often necessary, calls for a nice
knowledge of the contestants. Fixed rules are impossible.
That one man has a chance to sit long and think while the
other plays, and perhaps not always plays with as much
ability as effect, makes billiards pre-eminently the temperamental
game. There must, therefore, be much guessing in
the name of handicapping. Not a few conductors of tournaments
shirk their office by happily inveigling their players
into handicapping themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing is to be cautioned against. As a rule, if the
light-weighted, with their imposts, about fairly balance the
middleweights, they are apt to prove too heavy for the
heavyweights. To illustrate, A can give B 30 in 100, B give
C 30, C give D 20, and D give E 20. A in practice can possibly
give C the 60 required by theory, but he can little better
give D 80 than he can, as theory requires, give E 100 in 100!
Again, if there are many entries, those with a light impost
possess a decided advantage in having so much more to learn
than the others. The oftener they play, the relatively
better.</p>

<p class='c007'>If A can give B 12 in 100, B give C 15, and C give D 23, then
A should give C 25 and D 44, and B give D 35. It is all
merely a question of multiplication, division, addition and
subtraction, without being simple enough to look easy in
print.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process multiplies together the odds A gives B and B
gives C, as 12&nbsp;×&nbsp;15&nbsp;=&nbsp;180, which is to be divided by the number
of points (100) constituting game. The quotient, which is
nearer 2 points than 1, is to be reckoned as 2, and deducted
from the 15 B gives C, leaving 13, which, added to the 12
given B by A, makes 25 to be given by A to C. By a similar
process—multiplying together the 15 given by B to C and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the 23 given by C to D (15&nbsp;×&nbsp;23&nbsp;=&nbsp;345), dividing by 100 and
subtracting the 3 from the 38 (15 added to 23)—35 are what
B should give D. What A is to give D is ascertained by
multiplying together the 15 (less 2) and the 23 (13&nbsp;×&nbsp;23&nbsp;=&nbsp;389),
which, divided by 100, shows that 4 are to be deducted
from the added 13 and 23, leaving 32, which, added to the
12 A gives B, makes 44 to be given by A to D.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Scoring Tournaments</span>.—Owing to a faulty system of
keeping track of games played, not a few conductors of tournaments
are temporarily at a loss to determine with whom
some contestants have yet to play. This formulary covers
everything:</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Figures next to names stand for handicap, if any.</p>

<p class='c023'>Figures standing alone in squares are for total first, average next, and
highest run last.</p>

<p class='c023'>Winning and losing averages are both given, and in common fractions,
with the double purpose of showing which player led (in case of later dispute),
and of facilitating the making-up of general and tournament averages
when play is done.</p>

<p class='c023'>When a game is over, add an I to Games Won and an X to Games Lost.</p>

<p class='c023'>When tournament is finished add up totals, as well as innings (last
figures of those in middle line of squares), and compute single, general and
tournament averages decimally.</p>

<p class='c023'>To find out who has yet to play, look for blank spaces exclusive of those
running obliquely and marked D. (for Jones of horizontal column doubling
with Jones of vertical). In the table are four blanks, meaning two games
to play—Gray with Jones and Smith.</p>

<p class='c023'>To find out how many games have been played, add I’s and X’s together,
and divide by 2.</p>

<p class='c023'>When I’s and X’s differ in their totals, there has been an error in tallying
games either won or lost.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Scoring for the Press</span>.—Care should be taken to begin
with the score of him who plays first. His winning then will
mean that the innings were unequal, while putting the winner’s
score second will indicate equal innings. Disregard of
this rule, prevalent of late years, forces whoever would verify
the average to count up the innings in each score.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c012'>HOW TO FIGURE AVERAGES.</h3>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Decimals are Best.</span>—Divide total points by total innings.
Thus, 300 points in 28 innings show 10<span class='fraction'>20<br /><span class='vincula'>28</span></span> in crude
fractions, 10 and 5/7ths in the lowest evenly reduced ones,
and 10.71 (71/100ths) decimally. The first system seldom
gives an accurate idea at sight. In the second, the fractions
cannot always be reduced evenly, as above. Ordinarily, the
third is closest, briefest and clearest.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Avoid a Jumble.</span>—Some computers mix themselves and
others up by using all three methods. Others, as a convenience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>express the single average as 10<span class='fraction'>20<br /><span class='vincula'>28</span></span>, and the
general average not as 8<span class='fraction'>170<br /><span class='vincula'>175</span></span>, to be consistent, but as
8.97. This is akin to the barbarism of speaking in two languages
at once. There are others who, simply because it is so
divisible, convert the 8<span class='fraction'>170<br /><span class='vincula'>175</span></span> into 8<span class='fraction'>34<br /><span class='vincula'>35</span></span>, so that anybody
seeking to prove the average by finding the points and
innings will have rare figuring as a preliminary.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Decimalizing.</span>—This is simply adding a cipher to the right-hand
end of every remainder after the dividend has no unused
figure left. Adding a cipher to the 20 in 10<span class='fraction'>20<br /><span class='vincula'>28</span></span> yields 7 and
4 over when divided by 28, and now adding a cipher to the 4
will result altogether in 10.71, with 12 over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pay no attention to this remainder unless, if a general
average, 10.71 seems to be a tie with some other general
average. Such a tie will rarely happen. Should it, add a
cipher to the 12, and dividing the 120 by 28 will result in
10.714 (1000ths now, instead of 100ths), with 8 over. If there
is still a tie, proceed as before, first making 80 of the 8.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Give and Take.</span>—Had the 10.71’s remainder been 14 or
more, instead of 12, which is less than one-half the innings,
the average would change to 10.72. The arbitrary rule is to
ignore the final remainder when it is less than half the innings,
but enlarge it and give it to the player when it is half or more.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Reconversion.</span>—If for any reason it be necessary to find
the number of innings, add ciphers (two will usually be
enough in billiards) to the points, and divide by the decimalized
average. Thus 1071)30000(28 innings, with 12 over.
To find the points on which a general average is based,
innings (50) and average (16) being known, multiply the one
by the other—16&nbsp;×&nbsp;50&nbsp;=&nbsp;800.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>General Average.</span>—A match of continuous points has
but one average, whether it be played in one session or half a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>dozen; but it is different both in a tournament and in a match
of several separate games, a majority to win.</p>

<p class='c007'>In computing the general average, avoid the easy error of
adding all a player’s game-averages together, and dividing
the product by the number of games. There is only one
condition in which this will show the true average, and that
is when all the games have innings separately equal in
number, howsoever much the points themselves may vary.</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'>The average found by dividing by the number of games is
grossly extravagant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Losing Averages</span>.—Properly, the loser’s average can
never be higher than the winner’s. To concede that it can is
to premiumize its maker’s inefficiency. Setting out to win
the opening shot, he had failed, which is the only way, with
fewer points, to make the seemingly higher average. It is
equally unfair, in a continuous game of several sessions, to
concede an average for a fraction of the game. By getting
far behind, one player is without limit on any night, while the
other is stopped every night by reaching the number of points
assigned to every leader.</p>

<p class='c007'>Except as personal compliments, losing averages are valueless.
Their apparent makers do not wholly make them.
Much depends upon the other man. The loser reaches a high
figure largely because, having aimed to cover a given number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of points, he failed to do so. It has often happened that a
player with 50 to go has needed as many innings to make them
as he had taken to make his other 250. As a rule, losers “let
down” near the finish more than winners, and hence their
average is dependent less upon themselves than upon those
who close the game.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>First Chalking of Lines.</b> On every corner cushion rail, about
eight inches apart, the terminals of an imaginary line were drawn.
This line had no reference to jawing or crotching, already barred
by the articles of agreement, and yet its purpose was to prevent
what, without describing it, a Montreal paper had spoken of as
“Dion’s patent shot.” No one could be found who knew its nature.
Suspecting it to be a “kiss-back” from one ball dead against the
end-rail, one of the staff of the “N. Y. Times” suggested the line,
and the referee, Gershom B. Hubbell, marked it with the concurrence
of the players.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>First Public Game Played Under Protest.</b> Dion could not have
fully understood the purpose of the line. Because of it, he played
the latter half of the game under protest, Michael Phelan to decide.
As he won, the protest was needless. Had he lost, it would have
been useless. There has been only one other case of playing on after
protesting, instead of having the point decided then and there; and
in that other case the protester won because of a wrong decision
due to delay, and that, if given on the spot, would not have been
wrong, singular to say.</p>

Instead of in twos, threes, and fives, caroms were counted in threes
and sixes. Instead of two short games per session, there was one
long one (1200 points). For the first time in national championship

parallel in a tournament of leading experts. Playing off, Rudolphe
beat both Foster and Snyder, and Foster, in defeating Snyder by
1200 to 872, ran 492 and averaged 38.67—records in themselves
without being records of the tournament. Could Foster’s extra

both were within a certain distance of each other. While
500 points had not been found too long in practising for the
match, they proved too many in public competition, and when
100 points had been scored it was decided to shorten the game by
two-fifths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those games were not matches, and are not records. Not being
matches, they furnished no line at all as to Old Billiards vs. New.
This is the final four-ball chronicle as to professed experts of standing.
The revival of contests on pocketless tables, tested as early as 1860,
and abandoned outside of Philadelphia as too repressive of “safety,”
or generalship, had brought the game into disesteem for spectacular
uses. So small a table as a 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 for that way of going was almost
a burlesque of competitive billiards in the hands even of approximate
masters; and yet it remained for four-ball caroms to be played,
although by an inferior class of experts in the remoter West, on a
4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 carom!</p>

tables came into vogue, it was theoretically twice as hard to get the
crotch at three-ball caroms as at four-ball, and practically much
harder.</p>

pay for marking in a professional tournament, and the cue and the
$50 were awarded to Pihet. Later, there were half a dozen or more
matches for the emblem, with varying results.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span><b>First Three-ball Championship of America.</b> Tammany Hall,
N. Y. City, November 4–13th.—Special prizes were a gold watch
from Capt. Fred Grote for best run, a watch from Peter Totans for
best general average, and an emblematic gold medal from Matthew
Delancy. There were also a number of special playing-rules, no
one of which outlasted the championship itself. Among them was
one to bar crotching by requiring a 5½-in. oblique line on the bed of
the table. This had been suggested for another end in the Dion-Foster
match in Montreal in 1869 (see “First Protest” under Four-ball
Game). Accomplishing nothing except actually to increase
the crotching area by an inch, this, too, was speedily abandoned, an
imaginary line (on the principle of the spot-radius in the three-ball
game and the “string” in the four-ball) having been sufficient ever
since 1862.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tournament itself was an emphatic success, but the strange
rules confused the public and irritated the players; and for the first
time in a professional tournament a game was not completed, and
for the first time, also, a referee was impelled, in self-respect, to
vacate his office in rebuke of a player who refused to defer to the
official ruling. It is necessary to mention the unfinished game
(Garnier ahead of Ubassy by 274 to 246) for the reason that, as his
general average indicates in the table below, Garnier has a total of
but 2238, whereas, beaten only by Vignaux (11) and Daly (125),
he should have 2264. The average of the tournament, eight games
apiece, was 8.93.</p>

apiece averaged 16.10, which, while lower than the figures of earlier
tournaments, was yet higher than the general averages of all the
contestants in this one but Slosson, Schaefer, and Daly. Only half
the single averages in the appended table, viz., those of Schaefer,
Daly, Gallagher, and Rudolphe, are winning ones. This proved to
be the last tournament at the regular three-ball game to command
the presence of first-class experts in America.</p>

spring of 1879. Several of the contests after that were designed
chiefly to surpass the “run” and “average” records of one or two
professionals earlier in the wonder-working field; and so lamentably
did the unrestricted game decline that first-class players, avoiding
one another to the neglect of championships, welcomed matches
with fourth or fifth-rate ones on 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 tables.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>First Public Contests.</b> What is known simply as “Balkline” took
its name originally from the table’s having a continuous line running
around it six inches from the cushion. This form, with three shots
in balk, was practiced by Rudolphe and the Dions in 1875, pronounced
too difficult, and never played in public. The intersecting short
lines near every corner were added early in 1883, and the main line
was then put eight inches from the cushion; and in this form, with
its eight balks and the two shots or one valid count therein, as described
for the Champion’s Game, the “Balkline” was first played
publicly for the world’s championship in Central Music Hall, Chicago,
March 26th to April 6th. Of the seven contestants, Alonzo Morris
and Thomas Wallace were graduated from a preliminary tournament
held at the J. M. Brunswick &amp; Balke Co.’s warerooms, that city,
March 6–13th. In addition to the challenge emblem, there were
money-prizes aggregating $3,000, and the tournament was akin to a
marvel in embodying so many as seven players without a single tie.
Average of the twenty-one games, 12.86. J. Dion’s 17.71 and
Sexton’s 16.58 were their best averages—not winning ones. During
Sexton’s run of 170 the first glimpses in public were seen of what,
in 1890, was dubbed “The Anchor.” It had been played in private
at the regular three-ball game, but lacked favoring opportunities
at the Champion’s Game, while at Balkline it was impossible until
the eight short lines were added near the corners.</p>

Palmer on September 23, 1886, and others later at intervals, among
them McLaughlin twice (handicap 225 to 300), and finally became
owner of the emblem by defeating Pincus Levy, June 2, 1887, by
200 to 126 in a possible 150. What is worth recording here is not
in the play itself, but in the logic of the situation. That it was a
handicap championship necessarily made McLaughlin the champion
all along as the giver of the longest odds.</p>

roomkeepers engaged in another 14:2 handicap (John Cline, Ed.

15th. That four out of the nine in the tournament met on even terms
tended largely to overcome the logical objection to handicapping
as a championship factor. The table below exhibits a winning
average of 9.68 for one “scratch,” as well as a general average of
7.10. The challenge matches were always interesting, and often
impressive, as when, with a run of 76 and an average of 10.34,
Conklin took the emblem from Kellogg. McGinniss, like Kellogg,
Brown, and Dr. Parker, lost half his tournament games; but he
made amends by winning his whole six matches, thus acquiring
ownership of the “Mussey Medal,” in the final match for which,
August 15th, he averaged 7.50 against Adams.</p>

Sigourney (400 to 251, average 8.70), and then withdrew, Sigourney
losing the credit both of his victory and of his highest average,
instead of Schmitt’s forfeiting his other games. (See “Revival of
Cushion Caroms,” 1903.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Mial alone beat Sigourney, and Sigourney was the only one who
beat Norris (55 in 400). In playing off, Norris won by 25.</p>

<p class='c007'>February 19, as chief winner, Norris played Wilson P. Foss, who
was 100 when Norris was 71, 153 when he was 211, 237 when he was
307, and winner when he was 464. F., 500—6.85—52; N., 464—70.
The B. B. C. Co.’s Challenge Cup then became the property of Foss,
he having won it in tournament in 1900, defended it in 1901 match
with Conklin, and now in match against another Chicagoan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weeks before play began, the four entered into a parole agreement
to play off ties, as well as to divide the net receipts equally.
Months before that, the first three had signed a document requiring
all ties to be determined by the general averages, and specifying as
prizes only the emblem, the given money, and the entrance fees.
At the conclusion of the final game (Vignaux vs. Cure), it was
announced that ties would be played off in the same hall, beginning
February 25th. Vignaux declined to play off, claiming to have
won on general average, and carrying the case into court. Litigation

of the whole tournament were 111 by Rérolle (in the last game of
all, which was with Darantière, second winner) and 108 by Maure.
The third-best run seems to have been Darantière’s 89. The best
winning average was Rérolle’s 20 against Blanc. As to general
averages, there are no complete figures at hand as to any one of the
players; but Rérolle’s was probably not far below 15. The games
were 400 up. A special round of 250–point ones for a consolation
prize terminated as follows: Nélys, 3—0; Castel, 2—1; Faroux, 1—2;
Lamare, 0—3. In the deciding game of this round, Nélys vs. Faroux,
the former averaged 8.62, with 31 for high run to 27 for the loser
(Faroux).</p>

table retains them, inclusive of the 51 to 1 score by Conklin and Rein

79, which was actually the highest of the tournament, although Conklin’s
78 was awarded the special prize in consequence of the canceling

<p class='c007'><b>Professional 18:2 in Four Cities.</b> Beginning on February 5th
at “The Casino,” Philadelphia, Harry Cline, Al Taylor, Ed.
McLaughlin, T. J. Gallagher, and Albert G. Cutler played a round a
week in that city, Trenton, N. J., Maurice Daly’s in Manhattan, and
Frank A. Keeney’s in Brooklyn, the chief prize being a loving cup
presented by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co. Taken ill, McLaughlin
had to withdraw in Philadelphia. He played one game
in Trenton, the second stand, but had then to withdraw for good.
This series of games involved no championship. Cline won the cup,
and also made the highest averages, as a rule, but Gallagher made
the highest run (138). The best average was Cline’s 22.22, all
games being 400 up. At Daly’s, Cline, Cutler, and Gallagher tied,
but did not play off. At Keeney’s, Gallagher and Cline tied, and
did play off, Cline winning.</p>

that of the “Brooklyn Eagle” Gold Cup of 1901–5, was established
by the Chicago Athletic Association, the medium being a tournament
held at their gymnasium, Michigan Avenue, March 12th to
21st. Inclusive of an ornate silver cup, serving the winner-in-chief
as a perpetual memento of the initial tourney, all the prizes
but one were given by the C. A. A., the exception being another
silver cup, proffered by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., symbolizing
the American amateur championship, and needing to be
won by someone in two annual tournaments to confer permanent
possession. Games consisted of 300 points, and were fifteen in
number, exclusive of the three ties, which determined second, third,
and fourth prizes in favor of Demarest, Poggenburg, and Wright,
the game between the latter two at the same time deciding their
tie for high-average prize in favor of Poggenburg.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conklin and Poggenburg defeated Gardner and Mial in the extra
or play-off games, Poggenburg running 115 and averaging 42.86.
Neither the average nor the run counts against the figures in the
table. Nevertheless, the 42.86 was the highest of record for a player
of Poggenburg’s class.</p>

<p class='c007'>The regular games, 300 points up, were fifteen. In Chicago they
numbered the same, but were 400 points up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demarest’s victory in Chicago closed the series by making him
owner of the emblem, with 202 (in his tie game with H. A. Wright)
and 57.14 (in his regular-schedule game with E. W. Gardner) as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>the highest record run and single average of his class at 14:2. The
same is true of his general average of 21.22, which, could his two tie
games be computed with it, would be transformed into 23.19.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>This tournament is exceptional among professional ones in that
before his one defeat (by Schaefer) Daly had won the championship,
Wallace and Vignaux won play-offs. In thus defeating Schaefer,
Wallace ran 76 and averaged 7.25. Sexton’s 6.89 is a losing average.
The general averages of Daly and Schaefer were a close call, of which
the old form of expression (6<span class='fraction'>248<br /><span class='vincula'>451</span></span> and 6<span class='fraction'>238<br /><span class='vincula'>426</span></span>) gives scant

<p class='c007'>There was but one match. Sexton and Vignaux both challenged,
Daly resigned to Sexton as having priority, and Slosson challenged
on September 22d. Sexton thereupon named Chicago and unexpectedly
a 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 table for the contest. This was the first time that
a champion ever chose a place not his own residence, and such a
naming did not happen again until April, 1902, when, Schaefer and
Vignaux both being in Paris, the former named N. Y. City, and in
consequence there was no contest. Slosson was not to be balked,
and finally found himself up against a faster Collender cushion than
he had been given to practise with, which will explain the drop in
average.</p>

the winners of which severally were Chas. Davis, Joseph Cotton,
Davis again, and David Johnson. The last-named was at “scratch”
in two out of four, and Davis always at “scratch” except in the third,
when Reeves, playing 170 to his 150, tied him, but was beaten in

1.07. This made a tie for first prize among himself and Hyatt (30
each), John Daly (scratch at 35), Scovil (25), and Kasey (20), the
five having severally won seven times and lost thrice; and Daly, in
defeating Hyatt in the play-off, was reported in Chicago newspapers

needs verification.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November, in a tournament at Hauser’s room, St. Louis, the
press of that city credited G. Gundaker with running two 6’s and
two 4’s and averaging 1.20 in defeating Coon by 30 to 13. There a
4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 table was liable to have been used.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the same time, it reached here through Duluth, Minn., papers
that Wm. F. Hatley, in playing an amateur in that city, averaged
1.03 in 150. Here, too, a 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9 table was peculiarly liable.
Moreover, the length of the game suggests that it was an exhibition
of two or more sessions. Considering the number of points, the
average is phenomenal. It is not known to us that Hatley has ever
claimed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October, 1905, in Davenport, Iowa, Lloyd Jevne, in playing
Louis Magnus, was reported as having scored a game of 50 points in
41 innings, which is an average of 1.22. There was no higher run

<h3 class='c012'>BEST PERFORMANCES.</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are few unquestionable records. Most of the professional games,
whether short or long, have of late years been played in “academies” by
“academy” employees. To admit one such to record, on the plea that there
was a public admission-fee, as well as more or less of a staking, would be to
admit all. Then, again, this is a game that has never had a standard as to
length. It is unlikely that since 1878 there has been a better average for
50 points in a match than Wayman C. McCreery’s .94; but there may have
been before that year, and without attracting any attention whatever. In
a tournament game of 50 points at Mussey’s, Chicago, Avery surpassed it by
making .98 during season of 1901–2. The best verified run is 14. Two
amateurs made it—Peterson in St. Louis, and Avery years afterward in
Chicago, both in Mussey’s rooms. Also in Mussey’s, in 1905, James Shea,
another amateur, reached 1.03 in a game of 50, while Charles P. Day, in the
St. Louis tournament of November and December, 1907, attained to 1.32
in 50 points.</p>

<p class='c006'>The New York Racquet Club was the first to institute a national
championship of amateurs (1887–88–89–90), which it did not attempt
to renew. There was no second essay until the Amateur
Athletic Union entered the field in 1898–99. Anything in the nature
of amateur record, therefore, may be said to begin in 1887 and end in
1890, to resume in another direction in 1898 and continue until now.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Hugo Kerkau vs. Johann Trebar.</b> In 1900 these experts, German
and Hungarian, engaged in more than one series of “straight rail”
games in the chief cities of their respective countries. The two
were known to be far apart in skill. In one series, Kerkau scored
40,000 to Trebar’s 4998, and made runs of 1656, 1743, 2194, and 3843.
It invalidates these runs as comparisons with the lesser deeds of
earlier men that, although scarcely through fault of Kerkau, they
were not achieved under similar conditions. Years before he ran
his 3843, Kerkau ran 3092 against Woerz in Berlin. This was under
the old rule as to “frozen” balls, but it was probably also on a 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9
or smaller table. The 3092 were made in January, 1896. When,
not far from that time, Kerkau was here, he showed capacity for but
about half that height on a 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10.</p>

to going outside of a frame to count pocketings as “runs” that the
best players are not usually their makers. Such “runs” tend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>rather to come to losers. A player anxious to win cannot afford
to run a risk that, sometimes justifiable when far behind, is folly
when commandingly ahead. Besides, the rules themselves have
been in conflict, one championship code (expired) having required
the winner of one frame to open the next, while a later championship
code (also expired) made it optional with him. The Toledo game
was probably a mere exhibition. Clearwater has since holed 118
balls on a 4½&nbsp;×&nbsp;9.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>World’s Championship Tournament.</b> St. Louis, Mo., October
12th to November 2d.—For a trophy emblematic of the championship
of the world, and given by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co.,
with money prizes in addition. Contestants were Alfredo De Oro,
Jerome Keogh, Wm. H. Clearwater, Frank Sherman, Grant Eby
(all ex-champions then), Thomas Hueston, Charles Weston, and
Benjamin H. Brumby, of Marietta, Ga. This was Brumby’s first in
tournament, and he withdrew after playing four-sevenths of his
games. On a game-tally of 5—2 (beaten 11 balls in 125 by Brumby,
and 18 by Eby), De Oro tied Keogh and Hueston for the first
three prizes, and defeated both in playing off. The decisive game
was De Oro vs. Keogh, and the score 125 to 120. Having already
defeated Hueston, Keogh took second prize. Clearwater tied for
fourth and fifth on 4—3, Weston was sixth on 3—4, and Sherman
won no game apart from receiving forfeit from the Georgian. Hueston
was the first challenger in this series, wherein the stake must be
at least $150 a side, though by mutual agreement it may be more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Late in March, the official stakeholders, on appeal by Keogh,
awarded the championship and the full stake of $150 a side to the
challenger because of De Oro’s failure to comply with the rules as
to place and time of playing. De Oro was the next challenger, and
each side wagered $100 in addition to the usual $150.</p>

the emblem for the required one year, whereas he had forfeited it to

within ten days after being notified that he has been challenged.
Failure to do so, without sufficient cause therefor, will entitle the
challenger to the Emblem. The holder of the Emblem shall not,
however, be required to cover the money of more than one challenger
at a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. When $250 has been put up on each side, the $500, as well as
the Emblem, becomes subject to forfeiture. The remaining $250
must be put up at least ten days prior to the date of contest, and
after such final deposit the match shall be “play or pay,” i.e., death
alone relieving the players from their contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The holder of the Emblem may be required to play at the
expiration of sixty days from the time of being challenged, but not
before. Should either party refuse to play within the specified time,
he shall forfeit his claim to Emblem and stakes. Should both parties
conspire to defeat this or any other rule relative to the Balkline
Emblem, the match shall be declared off, and the stake money returned.
The Emblem will revert to the original donors.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. To define the above rule, a challenge issued while a match
for the Emblem is pending, and being next in order, shall go into
effect on the next day after that match has been disposed of either
through play or forfeiture. A challenge issued while there is no
match pending shall take effect on the day of its date, provided it is
not in any way subject to the rule next below.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>7. The challenge of a player who has been defeated while contending
for the Emblem shall not go into effect until fifteen days
after the contest in which he was defeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. There shall be no umpires, and no one will be allowed on the
platform after the game is called, except the contending players,
the referee and the marker. Should there be no platform erected
in the hall to set the billiard table on, and for the players to walk
on, then no person except the above mentioned shall be allowed
within ten feet of the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. The referee and marker to be mutually agreed upon by the
players. In case of failure on their part to agree before half past
seven o’clock of the evening of the match, then the donors of the
Emblem shall name the referee and marker.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. All games to be 500 points up.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. The holder of the Emblem will be required to defend it for
two years against all comers. During this probation he must
deposit with its donors, The Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., the
sum of five hundred dollars ($500) to insure its preservation in good
order, and its delivery to the donors before 12 o’clock noon of the
date named for any contest in which it may devolve upon him to
defend it. Failure to do so (without good and sufficient cause) will
entitle the challenger to the Emblem and the stake money, and the
donor of the Emblem to the amount deposited as a guarantee for its
safe-keeping and delivery, as hereinbefore provided for.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. The Emblem becomes the property of any player who wins
it from the champion and successfully defends it against all contestants
for a period of two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. In all matches for the Emblem, the stakeholders shall be
the donors of the Emblem, The Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co.,
and all challenges to the champion must be addressed through them,
in order that each challenge may be officially recorded, and the
champion officially notified.</p>

<p class='c007'>14. All matches for the Emblem shall be played with 2⅜-inch
balls, upon a 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 table, manufactured by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender
Co., and furnished with their “Monarch” cushions.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. The city in which contests shall take place must be located
in the country of which either party is a resident. In case of a disagreement
between the parties as to the selection of a hall or room
in which the contest shall take place, the donors of the Emblem shall
have the final decision.</p>

<hr class='c025' />

<p class='c007'><b>World’s Championship at 18:2.</b> The foregoing code governs,
with the following amendments and additions as adopted by the
undersigned players finally on April 4, 1906:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Sec. 4 is made partially inoperative as to a challenge issued at any
time within sixty days of the expiration of the two years’ term. The
champion must cover the forfeit, and himself either play or forfeit,
even if challenged as late as the day before his term would otherwise
expire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sec. 8 is amended so as to require a railing around the table, and
“not less than seven feet from the outer edge of the table.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Secs. 8 and 9 together are modified thus: “There shall be no
marker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The championship term in Sec. 12 is contingently prolonged as
provided in Sec. 4 above.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. The holder of the Emblem has the right to choose the city
wherein the contest shall take place. However, he is bound to select
a city located in the country in which he or his opponent has his
legal residence. In case of a disagreement between the parties as
to the selection of a hall or room in which the contest shall take
place, the donors of the Emblem shall have the final decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. All litigious points that might be raised by either of the
competitors in connection with the challenge herein mentioned,
either before, or during, or after the contest for the World’s Championship
Emblem of the 18–inch balkline (2 shots in) game of billiards,
shall be settled, without appeal, by the donors of the said Emblem,
and the competitors shall have to sign a copy of the present rules,
accepting The Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co. as supreme referee in
all difficulties that may arise between them on account of the contest.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c012'>THE ADDITIONS ARE:</h3>

<p class='c013'>1. There shall be no intermission, neither shall it be allowable
to brush the table or wipe the balls during the progress of the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Winner shall take all receipts and pay all expenses.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The balls shall have a medium-polish finish—that is, between
a dead finish and a high polish.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. There shall not be any string of markers over the table.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
